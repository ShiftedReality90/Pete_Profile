Hi there and welcome to my profile. A little about me; My name is Pete and it is a pleasure to meet you. I am 30 years old and currently live in wakefield with my wife, Louise. I was born in Seacroft, Leeds but moved to Wakefield in 2010. I first began learning code with a company called Coding Institute where I took a 5 day coding challenge and became addicted to coding and have self-taught skills in HTML and CSS over the last 9 -10 months in lockdown with various sites such as New Skills Academy, Udemy and Code Insitute. I wish to grow my knowledge and hopefully, build into a career. 

I am looking forward to learning here on The Coders Guild. Happy Learning!
